SOSx Bug Log


Checkpoint 1:

Bug: not printing characters, not interfacing with handler
Solution: keyboardirq assembly linkage to save registers
Time: 1 hour

Bug: keyboard not printing multiple characters
Solution: move send eoi so that it is always sent 
Time: 1 hour

Bug: RTC interrupts never happening
Solution: enabling interrupts for port 2 on the master
Time: 1 day

Bug: page fault when initializing paging
Solution: redo flags on each entry, no write through or caching, align pages
Time: 1 hours

Bug: page fault on page enable
Solution: reorder changing of registers, make sure to change cr4
Time: 2 hours




Checkpoint 2:

Bug: backspace not changing buffer
Solution: make sure to decrement index in write fuction as well
Time: 1 hour

Bug: buffer overflow not handled
Solution: check for overflow conditions before printing in handler and write
Time: 1 hour

Bug: control and alt keys printing space
Solution: check for null before printing, call separate functions with special keys
Time: 1 hour




Checkpoint 3:

Bug: not setting entry point correctly in execute
Solution: make buffer unsigned 
Time: 1 hour

Bug: could not keep track of last shell running
Solution: make parent parameter in pcb, set to -1 if nothing running
Time: 2 hours

Bug: page fault at iret
Solution: push user stack location onto stack before iret 
Time: 1 day

Bug: page fault with execute
Solution: save esp/ebp in pcb later to ensure correct
Time: 3 hours

Bug: not returning from halt correctly
Solution: make label at end of execute, return to label
Time: 2 hours

Bug: not reading from rtc
Solution: count interrupts in rtc 
Time: 1 hour




Checkpoint 4:

Bug: fish not printing to screen properly
Solution: map the vidmap page in every new page, not just the initialization
Time: 1 day




Checkpoint 5:

Bug: not printing to correct location in new terminal
Solution: clear screen before executing first shell in new terminal
Time: 1 day

Bug: page fault- not returning to old terminal correctly
Solution: redo paging and tss.ss0 before reseting esp/ebp to old values
Time: 1 day

Bug: triple faults with scheduling
Solution: call switch function in pit, not step through all processes
Time: 2 days

Bug: more triple faults with scheduling
Solution: redo paging
Time: 3 days

Bug: page fault when changing terminals quickly
Solution: change cli/sti
Time: 1 day

Bug: exiting last terminal halted programs
Solution: went back to go to user intsead of rerunning shell
Time: 1 hour

Bug: counter made cursor in other terminals misplaced
Solution: always write to terminal video memory, only print to screen at saved location if needed 
Time: 2 hours

Bug: cat rtc returning too quickly
Solution: move interrupt= 0 to before while loop
Time: 1 hour
